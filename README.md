All of the space engineers dedicated server on wine containers I found wouldn't build, and I embarked on a journey to create my own.

## Features:
* Wine 6
* Debian Buster
* Installs default star system world on first run
* Automatically updates ```<LoadWorld>``` element in ```SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg```
* Supports plugins.
* Image built and [available on dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mmmaxwwwell/space-engineers-dedicated-docker-linux)
* Easy to implement offsite backups, just copy everything in ```./appdata/space-engineers/config``` with your favorite backup tool.
* Reduced container size (~4gb decompressed).

## Prerequisites:
* docker
* docker-compose (recommended, not required to run container)
* unzip

## Tips:
* You can copy the entire contents of ./appdata/space-engineers/config to make a backup, including the SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg file.
* The ```./start``` script will start the server using docker-compose in detached mode, and then attaches to the log output. You can press <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> to detach from the logs and keep the server running.
* If you are running plugins, the first time your run this, check your SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg file for the Plugins element. If it spans multiple lines, you must replace it with ```<Plugins />```, exactly like that. The server will query ./appdata/space-engineers/config/Plugins and update the config file as needed from then on.
* If you start the docker container without placing SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg in the correct location, docker will create an empty folder where it should be. The container won't run until you stop the container, delete the empty SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg folder, and replace it with the actual file.

## Usage:

### -RECOMENDED- Pull from dockerhub and run with docker-compose

* Open up a command prompt.  Note: You must have sudo access.
* Create a user and group you want to run your space engineers server ```sudo adduser <username>```.  Note:  You can use an existing user on your system, but it's recommended to use a separate, dedicated user for maximum security.
* Clone this repo with ```git clone https://github.com/mmmaxwwwell/space-engineers-dedicated-docker-linux.git```.
* Change directory into the cloned repo with ```cd space-engineers-dedicated-docker-linux```.
* Run the setup script with ```./setup <username from step 2>```.  This will initialize the ./appdata folder, unzip an empty star system from star-system.zip and set the permissions for the docker user to run.
* (Optional) Copy your world data into the space-engineers-dedicated-docker-linux/appdata/space-engineers/config folder
* If you copied in world data, rerun the ```./setup <username from step 2>``` command to reset the permissions.
* Login as the user from step 2 and run the start script with ```./start```. This will start the server.

### Pull and run from dockerhub without docker-compose:
From this directory run :

``` 
docker run --restart always -p "27016:27016/udp" \
  -v $(pwd)/appdata/space-engineers/config/World:/appdata/space-engineers/World\
  -v $(pwd)/appdata/space-engineers/bins/SpaceEngineersDedicated:/appdata/space-engineers/SpaceEngineersDedicated\
  -v $(pwd)/appdata/space-engineers/bins/steamcmd:/home/se/.steam\
  -v $(pwd)/appdata/space-engineers/config/SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg:/appdata/space-engineers/SpaceEngineersDedicated/SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg\
  mmmaxwwwell/space-engineers-dedicated-docker-linux:latest 
```

## Exit Codes:
| Exit Code | Reason |
| - | - |
| 129 | Container is missing /appdata/space-engineers/World folder, volume mounts are mounted incorrectly. |
| 130 | Container is missing /appdata/space-engineers/World/Sandbox.sbc, World is not placed in the right folder, or the volume mounts are mounted incorrectly. Ensure your world is in ```./appdata/space-engineers/config/World/```.|
| 131 | Container is missing the dedicated server config file SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg. Ensure that you have placed SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg at ```./appdata/space-engineers/config/SpaceEngineers-Dedicated.cfg```. |
